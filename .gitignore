# State files
# The state file is the most critical file to ignore. It can contain sensitive data
# and should be managed with a remote backend in production, not in version control.

# These are created if Terraform crashes and are not needed in the repository.

# Variable files
# Exclude all .tfvars files as they often contain sensitive data like secrets or
# environment-specific values. The main `terraform.tfvars` is a common place
# for secrets.
